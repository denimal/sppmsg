# sppmsg
[In development] A quick and simple text communicator

My goal is to make this:
* fast
* fully-manageable - admins will be able to do everything with the users or groups using built-in command system or GUI.
* secure - messages will be encrypted (soon...)
* simple - don't confuse users with advanced settings until they are admins.
* open - it will be always free and open-source
* integrated - support for many protocols (soon...)

Note that there is a lot of refactoring to do...
* protocol documentation
* better Client GUI
* Server refactoring
